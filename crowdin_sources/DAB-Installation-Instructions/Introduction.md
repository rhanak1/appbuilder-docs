Dictionary App Builder does what its name suggests: it helps you to build customized dictionary apps for smartphones and tablets.


You specify the lexicon data file to use, the app name, fonts, colours, about box information, audio, illustrations and the icons. Dictionary App Builder will package everything together and build the customized app for you. You then install it on your mobile device, send it to others by Bluetooth or Wi-Fi transfer app, share it on microSD memory cards and publish it to app stores on the Internet.

**Keyboard App Builder** does what its name suggests: it helps you to build customized keyboard apps for smartphones and tablets. A keyboard app allows users to add a system keyboard to their device, enabling them to type in their language within other apps such as Gmail, Facebook and WhatsApp.


The keyboards are created using **Keyman Developer** ([https://keyman.com/developer/](https://keyman.com/developer/)).


To build an app, you specify the Keyman keyboard layouts and lexical models to use, the app name, fonts, colours, about box information, illustrations, and the icons. Keyboard App Builder will package everything together and build the customized app for you. You then install it on your mobile device, send it to others by Bluetooth or Wi-Fi transfer app, share it on microSD memory cards and publish it to app stores on the Internet.

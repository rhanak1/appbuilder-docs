# Introduction {#23280858a4b68023bd0ad8b0f67a1952}


You have built a great app, but can people find it, and do they want to install it?


When we talk about **App Store Optimization (ASO)**, we focus on two things: discoverability and conversion.

1. **Discoverability** - making it easier for users to find your app on the app store.
2. **Conversion** - increasing the likelihood of a user installing and trying out your app once they have found it.

In other words, we don't just want to create apps: we want people to find the apps, install them and use them.


We will begin by looking at the area of discoverability.

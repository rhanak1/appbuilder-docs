# Setting a book collection’s text direction {#23780858a4b6806cac5eda4128cb0220}


To set the text direction for an entire book collection, go to **Books** → [**Collection Name**] → **Styles** and select the direction from the **Text Direction** selector. This will not affect the UI, just the book texts.

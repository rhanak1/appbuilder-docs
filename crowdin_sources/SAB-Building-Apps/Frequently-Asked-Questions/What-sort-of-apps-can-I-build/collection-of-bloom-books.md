# A collection of Bloom books {#23780858a4b680b0a311c0a6839172e6}


While the Bloom reader app gives access to any published Bloom books, it might fit your context better to have a contextualized app for a language group that includes just the Bloom books you want to group together. To do this, create an app with multiple books (in a single book collection) that you import from Bloom. Add a contents menu to clearly show which books are available.


See the following:

- [Importing Bloom books](/bloom-books) into your app
- Using a **[Problem Internal Link]** to access the books.
- Including **[Problem Internal Link]**.

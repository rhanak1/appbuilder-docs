# Hybrid apps (combining different app modules) {#23780858a4b680938b9dd2a27976dda5}


Depending on your Scripture Engagement goals, you may decide to create apps that have only one module (i.e. a songbook app) or have several modules (e.g. Scripture text with a lectionary, or a picture story book with several quizzes).


It is normally advised to put these different resources all under the same book collection if they are all in the same language. If you put them in separate collections, you will probably have to disable two-pane and verse-by-verse views under **Books** â†’ **Layouts** as those are designed for parallel (linked) Scripture translations.


If you do have different types of resources in the same book collection, however, they will by default appear in the drop-down book selector (on the app menu bar) with all other books in the collection. This may be confusing for the user and/or result in a long and unwieldy list of books to scroll through. In this case, it is preferable to hide certain books from the list.


For example, if your app has a New Testament, a song book and several quizzes, it is best to have the Scripture books available in the drop-down book list and hide the others. You will then need to make a **[Problem Internal Link]** with links to the hidden resources so the user can access them.


To disable a book from appearing in the drop-down book selector, select the book in the project tree view, click on the **[Problem Internal Link]** tab and choose **No** under **Show in book selector**.

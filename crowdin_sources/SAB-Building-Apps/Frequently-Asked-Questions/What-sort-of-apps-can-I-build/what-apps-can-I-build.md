Scripture App Builder is very versatile, and you can build quite a few different types of apps including straight Scripture apps, Bible story books, lectionaries, literacy books song books and quiz books.  You can even combine these different types of “modules” into a single app according to your wider [Scripture Engagement](https://scripture-engagement.org/) strategy. Think of the “building blocks” that you have--Scripture texts, audio, videos, Bible study materials, Bible images—and prayerfully seek how to combine them in different ways in different apps to help people engage with God’s Word.

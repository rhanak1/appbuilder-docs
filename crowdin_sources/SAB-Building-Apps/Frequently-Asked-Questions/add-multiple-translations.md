# **Why and how should I add multiple translations to my app?** {#23780858a4b68087ad62d898dcf1efd5}


You can include more than one Bible translation or script in your app, for example:

- A local language translation together with a translation for a neighboring language.
- A local language translation together with a translation in a major language such as English or French.
- A translation in Roman script together with the same translation in a different script such as Arabic.
- A translation together with the original language texts in Hebrew or Greek.

You are not limited to two translations. You can choose to include three or more translations if you need to. However, the more translations you include, the bigger your app will become.


To add another translation, you will need to _create a new book collection_.

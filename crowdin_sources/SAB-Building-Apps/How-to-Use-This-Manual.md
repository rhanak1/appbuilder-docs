# How to Use This Manual {#23380858a4b680e4b2aff6cb94c5f1f0}


Scripture App Builder (SAB) has many features to help users engage with the Scriptures. It is recommended that you at least familiarize yourself with the many options available by taking a brief look over all the chapter topics.


If you are new to SAB, it is recommended that you read sections 1, 2 and 3 of this manual before running the New App wizard for the first time. Section 4 has some Frequently Asked Questions. Sections 5 and on systematically cover the menus, project features and configuration settings.


This guide includes notes and tips to help you get the most out of the software. Tips and notes will appear like this:


**Notes:**

Most of the interface items in your app can be customized through the User Interface (UI) styles. For each section, the related UI styles will be shown in text boxes like the following:


| **To modify this…**          | **Adjust this style…** |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Navigation drawer background | ui.drawer              |
| Navigation drawer item text  | ui.drawer.item.text    |


See Appendix 3 for a comprehensive list of styles and explications.

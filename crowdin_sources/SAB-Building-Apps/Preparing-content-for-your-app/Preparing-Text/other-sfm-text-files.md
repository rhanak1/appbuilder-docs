# Other SFM text files {#23380858a4b680eebadacdc01dad4120}


SAB can import text from SFM files which contain content other than Bible books, such as commentaries, Bible studies, stories or songs. Like Paratext USFM files, the chapters, section headings and paragraphs need to be marked by standard format markers such as \c, \s and \p.


The first marker in the file must be in the form **\id XYZ**, where XYZ is a unique, alphanumeric code you choose (with no spaces). Do not choose a code already reserved for a Scripture book, e.g. GEN, or any other book in your project.


SFM book files must be **plain text files**. If you have Unicode characters, the text files should use UTF-8 encoding.


To create a text file in Windows, use a text editor such as Notepad (which allows you to set the Encoding to UTF-8 when you save).


To create a text file on a Mac, use TextEdit, remembering to choose Plain text files in the preferences because otherwise the default file type is RTF (which contains a lot of additional formatting codes).


For more details about how to define picture story books and song books using SFM text files, please see sections 23 and 24.

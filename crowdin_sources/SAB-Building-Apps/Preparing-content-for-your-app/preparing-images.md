# Preparing images {#23380858a4b68047b306c80139429f08}


Images are imported automatically from Word documents or need to be specified separately if you use SFM format. They should be in JPEG or PNG format. Certain interface items require a particular format, size or shape, and that will be specified in the descriptive text on that screen in SAB. For example, the navigation drawer image is required to be a PNG file with an aspect ratio of 16:9.


Keep the image size small enough so that they display well on a small screen and will not make the app size too large. If your pictures are in a Word document, you can use the **Compress Pictures** tool in Word. Otherwise, SAB will allow you to resize the images after you have added them to the app project.

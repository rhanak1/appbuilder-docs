# APK {#23780858a4b680f095aedb2a8761d6b5}


APK stands for Android Package and is an app installation file. An APK file is the result of compiling an app in SAB and is the file that needs to be copied to a target phone to install and run the app. As such, the name of the APK is primarily only important to distinguish it from other files. If the user will receive the APK directly (via file transfer or WhatsApp message or something similar), and therefore will be able to actually see filename, the name of the APK should clearly reference the project or app name. Selecting the checkbox to **Append version name** (number) to the filename can also help with distinguishing between versions. If the app is installed from the Play Store, the user will not see the APK file.


The **Version code** is just an internal number that you can use within your project as you do internal updates.

# Expiry {#23780858a4b68035b1bbc1034812ec36}


Normally, if your app is published to the Play Store or App Store, you don’t want it to expire.  If you want to update it, adding books or functionality, you can just publish the update and users will be able to get the new version.  However, if you are creating a test version to distribute informally, you will probably want to set an expiration date.


There are three options on the Expiry tab for setting the app duration:


**App does not expire**


This is the default and appropriate for published apps.


**App expires on a specific date**


You can specify a date when all copies of the app will expire on all phones. This would be appropriate for a test version that you want to be in circulation for a limited time before getting feedback.


**App expires a certain number of days after it is installed**


You can specify a number of days (up to 1000) that the user can access the app before it expires. Again, this might be useful for a test period.


You can also display an optional message when the app expires. There are two options here as well:


**Show message and exit app**


This would be appropriate for ending a trial period and telling people to watch for the release version of the app, or perhaps to contact a certain person in order to give feedback.  After showing the message, the app exits and cannot be run again.


**Show message but allow the user to continue using the app**


This would be appropriate, for example, if the test version is accurate (consultant checking has been finished on the books) and the app has been distributed from phone to phone, especially if it is difficult for the user to get an updated version over the internet.


You can type the desired message in the text entry area at the bottom of the screen.

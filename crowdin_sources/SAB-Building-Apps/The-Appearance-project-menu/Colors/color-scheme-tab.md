# The Color Scheme tab {#23880858a4b68027ab30c14bb90eb2f0}


SAB comes with around 28 pre-made color schemes. The color scheme affects the menu bar, bottom navigation bar icons, font sliders, book selection tabs and title text color. Click on the scheme you want and then choose which themes (**Normal**, **Sepia** and **Dark**) the user will have access to. These will appear under the text size (AA) icon on the menu bar.

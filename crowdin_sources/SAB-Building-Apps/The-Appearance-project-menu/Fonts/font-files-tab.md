# The Font Files tab {#23880858a4b680249b30e4d174bfe082}


Use this tab to specify all the font files from which you can choose for the main font and fonts available under the **Fonts** tab at the Book or Book Collection levels.


Click **Add Font…** and specify a reference “**Family name**” for the font.  Then either select one of the suggested common SAB fonts or one of your own choosing. After clicking Finish, the font will be added to the list of available fonts from which to choose.


Right-click on a font file in the list to either delete it or edit its properties.

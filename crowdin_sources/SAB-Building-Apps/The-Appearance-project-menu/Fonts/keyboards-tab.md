# The Keyboards tab {#23880858a4b680d79589def6f0a57fae}


Use the **Keyboards** tab to specify one or more Keyman keyboards to include in your app. This allows users to use the keyboard for typing notes etc. in their language(s). The **Keyboards** tab includes links to [Keyman Developer](https://keyman.com/developer) (for creating your own keyboards) and the [Keyman](https://keyman.com/) website. It is worth checking the website to see if someone has already created the keyboard you desire.


**Important:** To allow the user to use a keyboard, make sure and select it at the Book Collection level on the _**Styles**_ tab.

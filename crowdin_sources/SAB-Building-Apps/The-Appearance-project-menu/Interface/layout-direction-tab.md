# **The Layout Direction tab** {#23780858a4b68041b9a5c2336ca657ca}


The UI layout direction affects the position of the book name in the menu, and the side from which the navigation drawer slides out.  There are four options:


**1. Left to Right** – the default, with the book name displayed in the upper left and the navigation drawer sliding out from the left side.


**2. Right to Left** – with the book name displayed in the upper right and the navigation drawer sliding out from the right side.


**3. Use the direction from the current user interface language**. If the current language is normally written in a certain direction, the app will mirror that setting. This means that a user may change the app language in the settings and the app will respond with the correct UI direction.


**4. Use the direction from the text being displayed**. This will depend on the book text being displayed in the screen area, or the top screen in two-pane view. See _**Setting a specific book’s text direction**_**.**

# Styles {#23880858a4b68059a0bff6a0cf009ef8}


One of the powerful advantages of Scripture App Builder is the ability to make a fully-contextualized app for a specific target language and culture. To that end, SAB gives the app designer a lot of control over the text and interface styles. To see specific references and explanations to all the styles available in SAB, see _**Appendix 3**_.


Each style has multiple fields that can be customized, stored as underlying CSS fields. Styles are divided into two main categories: **Text Styles** and **User Interface Styles**. You can also create **Custom Styles**. Use the **Find** feature to search for a particular style to modify. If you know the USFM marker for the style, you can try using that for searching. For example, if you want to modify the style of a line of poetry, search for either “**poetry**” or “**q**” which is the USFM poetry marker.


Each style lists the **Name**, **Description** and **Designation**—the specific characteristics of the style. Double-click on a style to display the **Edit Style** dialog box. Use the **Style Properties** tab to modify the style and/or the **CSS** tab to add or modify specific style elements. Click **OK** when done. The modified style name will now be displayed in blue to show that it has been changed. To revert to the default values, right-click on the style and choose **Reset to Default**.


The **Appearance → Styles** menu is for setting “app level” styles.  Styles can be set in 3 places: at the app level, the book collection level and the book level. By default, styles set at the app level apply to all collections and books. Some styles are only applicable to the app itself (e.g. menus, navigation drawer etc.). However, many styles, especially text styles, can be individually set for collections and/or specific books.

This is a broad category that contains many marker styles available in Paratext that are automatically transferred, and many other descriptive and functional elements in the appâ€™s content. These include different text categories like chapter and verse markers, poetry, tables, headers, footnotes, links, glossary words etc. Also included in the text styles are the various elements for quizzes (see the document _**Creating Applications with Quizzes**_). Use the **Find** feature to search for a particular style. For more information, see _**Appendix 3**_.

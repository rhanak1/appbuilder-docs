# Changes {#23880858a4b6804f92cdee5f46e20d04}


You can define a set of regular expression “find and replace” changes to apply to the text in your source files. The changes will be applied during the app build process and the original source files will not be changed. For example, if you have added Paratext files from a Paratext folder that receives updates from your team and yet you need to modify certain text styles or markers to display correctly in the app, you should apply those modifications using the Changes feature. In this way, they will not be overridden by Paratext updates, or affect the Paratext project itself.


Changes applied at this level will affect the whole app. You can use the Changes tab _in the book collection_ or book menus for changes at those levels.


Once Change items have been added, you can turn them off or on by clicking in the **Enable** checkbox.  Right-click on a Change item to edit or delete it.

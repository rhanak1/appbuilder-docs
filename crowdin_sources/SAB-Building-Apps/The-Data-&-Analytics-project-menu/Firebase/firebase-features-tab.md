**Firebase Analytics**


To sign up for Firebase Analytics, ensure you have a Google account.


You will need to:


1. Go to the Google Firebase website at [https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/) and ensure you are signed in with your Google account.


2. Click **Add project** to create a Firebase project for this app.


3. In Step 1, you will need to give your new project a **Project name**.


4. In Step 2, titled **Google Analytics for your Firebase project**, select **Set up Google Analytics for my project** and press **Continue**.


5. In Step 3, titled **Configure Google Analytics**, click on the drop-down box and choose **Create a new account**. Give it a name, which can be the same as your Firebase project name.


6. Check the boxes to confirm that you accept the analytics and data protection terms. Click **Create project** and wait a few seconds for the project to be created.


7. Click the Settings button (a cog wheel icon near the top) and select **Project settings**.


8. On the **General** tab of the Settings, scroll down to the **My apps** section and click the Android app icon.


9. On the **Add Firebase to your Android app** page, enter your app package name and click **Register app**.


10. Download the config file, **google-services.json**. That is all you need from the app registration. You can ignore the information on the rest of the screens and return to Settings.

12. Select **Firebase Analytics** as one of the features to use in the app.


13. On the **Firebase Configuration →** **Android** tab, click the **Browse** button and find the **google-services.json** config file that you have just downloaded from the Firebase console.

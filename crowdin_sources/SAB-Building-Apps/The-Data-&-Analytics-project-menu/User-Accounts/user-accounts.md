# User Accounts {#23880858a4b6804e97deef748504fbb0}


You can configure your app so that a userâ€™s highlights, notes and bookmarks are saved to a database server. This means that the user can see them on another device, and they do not need to lose their work when they change their phone.


To enable this feature, you need to do some configuration work in two places:

- within Scripture App Builder, and
- in the Google Firebase console.

# The Daily Reminder tab {#23980858a4b680128720c91e6fc717d3}


Your app can be configured to send a daily reminder to read the Bible. The reminder appears as a notification in the device’s notification tray. When you tap on it, the app will open.


These notifications work offline. They are sent from the app rather than being sent over the internet. The user can turn on or off this feature and set their preferred time of day for the notification in the _app settings_ screen.


By default, **Daily Reminder** notifications are not included in the app. To configure them in the app builder:


1. Select **Include Daily Reminder** **in this app**. If this option is not selected, a Daily Reminder will not be included in the app and the app user will not be able to turn it on.


2. If you want the notifications to be turned on by default, select **Turn on Daily Reminder** **by default**. If this option is not selected, the user will need to go to the Settings screen in the app in order to turn on the notifications.


3. Choose a default **Time of day** for the Daily Reminder to appear. The user will be able to change this in the _app Settings_.


4. You can customize the **Title** of the Daily Reminder and the **Message** that is displayed. You can add different text translations for any of the interface languages you have selected in **Appearance** → **Interface →** **Languages**.

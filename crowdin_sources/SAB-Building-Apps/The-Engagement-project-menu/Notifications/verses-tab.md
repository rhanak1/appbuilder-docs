# The Verses tab {#23980858a4b6802a966bedd5d01b2b96}


Use the **Verses** tab to verify the list of verses from which the app will pull the verse notifications. SAB will create the list based on the actual Scripture books available in the app.


You may want to change a day’s specific verse for a significant cultural event or holiday. To do this, double-click on the date and choose an alternate verse.


Use the **Special Dates** tab to modify which verses are displayed for the specified special dates.


SAB pulls verses from its **verses.txt** file, located under the Scripture App Builder installation folder (by default on Windows, the installation folder is **C:\Program Files(x86)\SIL\Scripture App Builder)** under the **info** subfolder.


Click **Rebuild Choice of Verses** to randomly reassign verses for the year, pulling from the verses.txt file.


Click **Export…** to export the current list of verses in a simplified text file.  You can edit this list and then use the **Import…** button to reimport it to SAB.


:::note

_If you modify_ _**verses.txt**_, _it is liable to be overwritten next time you install an updated version of SAB. Similarly, if you modify a verse in the list on the_ _**Verses**_ _or_ _**Special Dates**_ _tabs or import your own verses, choosing_ _**Rebuild Choice of Verses**_ _will overwrite your changes._

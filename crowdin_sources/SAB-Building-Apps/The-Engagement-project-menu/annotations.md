# Annotations {#23980858a4b680a1b1d6dff779340112}


Annotations provide ways for a user to deepen their personal interaction with and study of the Scriptures. If the user taps a verse in the app, it will be selected (underlined) and the text selection toolbar will appear at the bottom of the screen. From this toolbar they can choose to highlight the selected text, add a note, place a bookmark, play audio beginning at this verse, copy the text to the clipboard or share it. For more information on settings styles for annotation features, see _**Appendix 3**_.


Users can synchronize their highlights, notes and bookmarks with another device. To enable this, please see the section on _User Accounts_.


:::tip

_If your book is not a Scripture text (i.e. does not have verses), by default you will not be able to tap on a sentence to highlight it. If you want users to be able to select the sentence, you will need to add_ _**\v**_ _verse markers to the book file but then hide the verse markers so they don’t show. To do this, select the book in the collection and choose the_ _**Features**_ _tab. Use the_ _**Show Verse Numbers**_ _selector and set it to off._

**Highlighting**


Users cannot highlight titles or sub-headings, just verses of Scripture (or books with hidden verse markers). To highlight one or more verses, the user can do the following:


1. Tap on the verse or verses. The app will underline them.


2. Select the highlighter pen button from the text selection toolbar.


3. They will get a choice of highlighter pen colors: yellow, green, orange, blue and pink. Tap on one of them.

To remove a highlight, a user can do the following:


1. Tap on the verse or verses for which they want to remove the highlighting.


2. Select the highlighter pen button from the text selection toolbar.


3. Choose the white color to remove the highlighting.


To view a list of highlighted verses, the user can select **Highlights** from the app’s navigation drawer menu. On this screen one can sort highlights by date, reference or color (tap on the Sort button on the app bar). One can delete highlights or tap on an item to go to the highlighted verse. One can also share the list of highlighted verses with someone else (tap on the Share button on the app bar).


:::note

Only full verses can be highlighted. A single tap to select a verse provides a simple interface for users and is much easier to do than dragging start and end cursors to select a string of words_._

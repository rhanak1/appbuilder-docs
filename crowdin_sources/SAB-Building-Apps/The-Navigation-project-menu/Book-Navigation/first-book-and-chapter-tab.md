If there is no contents menu, you can specify which book and chapter is displayed when the app starts for the first time. You can select from any book in the primary book collection.

_You may choose to open at a “Getting Started” or “Help” book to give the user help in learning how to navigate in your app. You can create this using the Word or SFM formats and add it to the primary book collection._

Normally, you will want to open the app at the last book viewed, but you can specify here to always open at your specified First Book and Chapter.

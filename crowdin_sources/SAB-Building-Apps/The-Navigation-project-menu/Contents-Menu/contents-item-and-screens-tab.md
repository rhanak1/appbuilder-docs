# The Contents Items and Screens tab {#23980858a4b68074be30c0681c7ea6c0}


Contents menus are comprised of Items (clickable elements), headings (non-clickable items) and screens (groups of items).


**Contents Menu Items**


1. For each contents menu item you want to add, click the **Add Item…** button and follow the wizard to add the item to the screen. You will need to specify:

- The **target reference**, such as Luke 15 verse 1. This reference can be a book name, or a book and chapter, or a book chapter and verse. If the book is not a Scripture book, you can still select which page to open. If you have multiple book collections, you can specify an associated layout.

:::tip

_If the book does not have a linked book in another collection (i.e. the 2 pane view would not be able to show the same book in another collection), then choose single-pane view._

:::



- The **title** of the item, such as ‘The Lost Sheep’
- An optional **subtitle**
- An **image** (optional) – to appear to the left of the title.

:::tip

T_ry and make your contents menu item images the same dimensions. Alternatively, you can set the_ _**Image width**_ _percentages to all be the same on the_ _**Contents**_ _**Settings**_ _tab under_ _**Contents Items Display**_.

:::




2. You can reorder the items on the screen by selecting rows in the table and dragging up or down.


3. Go to the **Contents Settings** tab to specify display formatting and navigation options for the menu.


:::tip

_By default the contents menu will show the item reference (e.g. chapter and verse). You can turn this off by unselecting_ _**Show item references**_ _in the_ _**Contents Settings**_ _tab._

:::




4. Select the **Viewer** tab to see how the contents menu will appear in the app.

**Contents Menu Headings**


You can add non-selectable headings or dividers in your lists of items in the menu. You may want to do this to group certain items under a header, or just to provide some decoration.  To add a Heading, click **Add Heading…**


:::tip

_To make a decorative heading, create a landscape image and set its width percentage to be 100%. Do not add a title or subtitle._

:::




**Contents Menu Screens**


In some cases, you might want to have multiple contents screens (nested groups of items), i.e. you select an item in the first screen and it takes you to a second contents screen.


:::tip

_Grouping your items under screens can really help users find and access the content in your app, especially if you have different types of books and/or extra-Biblical content like front and back matter, glossaries, Bible studies etc. It is recommended to sketch out a proposed layout for your menus and then create the screens and items necessary._

:::




A screen is a group of items. Items on a screen can lead directly to books, or to other screens. By default a contents menu has one implicit screen called “**HOME**.”


To add a contents screen:


1. Click the **Add Screen…** button and give the screen a name.


2. You will need to link to this new screen from the screen a level above (its parent screen). Select the parent screen by clicking on it so it highlights. Click the **Add Item…** button for that parent screen, specify its target to be **Another menu screen** and select the name of your new screen. This will mean that when the user taps on this item in the first screen they will be taken to your new screen.


3. Add menu items to your new screen as described above.


:::tip

_Make sure that the screen to which you want to add an item is selected by clicking to highlight it on the_ _**Contents Items and Screens**_ _page. Then click_ _**Add Item…**_

:::




4. You can move items between screens by dragging item rows up or down.

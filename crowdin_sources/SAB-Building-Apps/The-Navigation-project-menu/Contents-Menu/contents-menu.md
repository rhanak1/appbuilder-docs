# Contents Menu {#23980858a4b6801ca0ddfe053ff3d7a5}


When the user launches the app you might want to display a contents menu, giving them an easy way to jump to books and specific references. This can be an essential part of helping users engage with Scripture and locate other content in your app that otherwise might be hard to find e.g. front and back matter material, storybooks, a thematic index or glossary. For more information on setting the styles for the various contents menu elements, see _**Appendix 3**_.


The contents menu contains a list of images and titles and can have several levels as needed.

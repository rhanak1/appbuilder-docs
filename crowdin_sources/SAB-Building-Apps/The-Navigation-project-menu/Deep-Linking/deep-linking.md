# Deep Linking {#23980858a4b6805a80a0fd5920cbd857}


Deep Linking allows you to direct people to specific pages within the app, using a link on a website, in a messaging app, social media or email.


A deep link can look something like this:
mamara-bible://LUK.15
or
[https://mamara.org/bible/LUK.15](https://mamara.org/bible/LUK.15)
or
[https://www.wycliffe.org/mexico/huichol/bible?ref=LUK.15](https://www.wycliffe.org/mexico/huichol/bible?ref=LUK.15)


If you share one of these links with a friend on WhatsApp, Facebook or email, and they tap on the link on their smartphone, the app (if already installed) will open and go directly to Luke chapter 15.

# The Search tab {#23980858a4b68013ac98fa853ab1b58e}


The Search function allows users to find words across all book collections. There are several options you can set to specify how searches take place.


**Show Search icon and allow searching**


If you enable this, the **Search** menu item will appear in the navigation drawer menu and the magnifying glass search icon will appear in the app menu, if there is room.


**‘Match whole words’ is selected by default**


You can choose whether or not users are restricted to searching for whole words.


**Show ‘Match whole words’ option on the Search page**


This allows the user to turn off or on the ‘match whole words’ functionality.


**‘Match accents and tones’ is selected by default**


You can choose whether or not users are restricted to searching using accents and tones, if there are any in the language.


**Show ‘Match accents and tones’ option on the Search page**


This allows the user to turn off or on the ‘match accents and tones’ functionality.


**Show special character input buttons on Search page**


If you are allowing searching matching accents and tones, it is very helpful to include a list of any special characters (that would require an accent or tone marker) to be available for the user to select from.


**Specify the replacements and diacritics to remove…**


If you are not requiring ‘Match accents and tones,’ it is important to specify which characters should have simple equivalents. You can either the syntax X &gt; Y, with X being the accented character and Y being the non-accented equivalent (e.g. à &gt; a) OR just specify the Unicode character number of the diacritic to remove.

# The Sharing tab (sharing apps) {#23980858a4b680248859feb2533a45cd}


One advantage of a digital Bible over a printed one is that users can freely share the Scriptures with other people. SAB provides several, helpful ways to share an app with others. You can choose to allow the user to use any or all of them:


**Share link to app on Google Play**


We strongly recommend publishing your apps to the Google Play store so that the diaspora can have access, even if your local context don’t have internet access. If you have published it, then use this setting to provide an easy way to share the link via email or social media (e.g. WhatsApp).


**Share link to app on website**


Enable this if you have your APK available to download from an external site (e.g. a language-specific website for a translation project).


**Share app installer file**


Enable this to share your app’s APK file directly with another device, e.g. by Bluetooth, Wifi transfer or email. This option is especially useful in contexts where not everyone has easy internet access and where you want to promote offline app sharing.

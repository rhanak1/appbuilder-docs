# E-books (EPUB) {#23980858a4b680659a29d8ff3f468970}


**As well as building a smartphone app, you can create e-books in EPUB format. EPUB documents are readable by a number of e-book readers on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android platforms.**


If you have timing files for your audio, the e-books can contain ‘Read Aloud’ text-audio synchronization. These are readable by a few EPUB 3 readers, such as [Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html) or [Thorium Reader](https://www.edrlab.org/software/thorium-reader/).


To create an EPUB e-book:


1. Choose whether to create a single e-book containing all the books or whether you want to create a separate e-book for each book. The latter is the best option if you will have audio in the book, since otherwise a whole NT with audio would be a very large e-book.


2. Choose a cover design. See the **Cover** If you are creating separate e-books for each book, a different cover image can be specified for each book on the Cover tab of each individual Book page.


3. Go to **Publishing** → **E-books (EPUB)** and click the button **Create EPUB Document(s)**.


The generated EPUB documents will be saved in the default EPUB output folder. See **Tools** → **Settings…** → **Default Folders**.


4. Open the EPUB documents in your chosen e-book reader.


Scripture App Builder generates EPUB 3 documents which should be backwardly compatible to be able to be read using EPUB 2 readers. EPUB 3-only features such as the text-audio synchronization will only be seen on compatible readers.

# Build Multiple Apps {#23780858a4b680719f4be326231c345e}


In some cases it may be expedient to set multiple app compiles going at one time. This may take a long time, however, depending on available memory. Selecting Build Multiple Apps displays a dialog listing the currently open projects in SAB. You can check or uncheck the box next to each app project to select whether it is built. Use the drop down list box to choose whether you want to build APKs or Android App Bundles.

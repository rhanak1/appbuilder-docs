# View Project Folder {#23780858a4b680fe89a6d548419d3894}


This will open the current project’s project folder. This folder holds the project’s .appDef configuration file and the project’s data subfolders.  See _How SAB stores your project data files_.


:::tip

_If you want to share your app project with someone else (i.e. someone who can help you test and find problems with your app), you’ll need to give them your project folder and all it contains. They can copy it into their own App Projects folder, open it in SAB and use their own, temporary keystore to build, run and test your project. If audio files are necessary for your app and they are not stored in your project’s audio subfolder, you will need to copy those separately._

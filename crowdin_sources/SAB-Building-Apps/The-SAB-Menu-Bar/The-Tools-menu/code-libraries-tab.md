**JDK Location**


The Java Development Kit is a required set of code libraries for building apps. The normal SAB installation process should prompt you to download and install the JDK, and the **JDK Location** field should show the location of the installed files. If for any reason this is blank, or you need to change the version of the JDK, you can either **Browse** to another version already on your computer, or use **Install JDKâ€¦** to download and install a new version.


**App Builder Location**


This is the folder in which SAB was installed. If you need to install a previous version for test purposes, you can download it from the **Previous Versions** section at the bottom of the [SAB download page](https://software.sil.org/scriptureappbuilder/download/) and Browse to it here.

# Build Android App {#23780858a4b68039bfdafbae3d5f0f18}


This menu item will initiate the compilation of the currently selected project, duplicating the functionality of the **Build Android App APK** item on the **Build** menu. Note that multiple, device-specific APKs will be built instead of one, comprehensive APK if the **Generate device-specific APKs…** option is selected under the **App → APK → Multiple APKs** tab.

# Quiz Files {#23280858a4b6806dbd22dc5cda940889}


Quizzes are developed using **text files** (.txt), created with a text editor such as **Notepad**. Do not use a word processor such as Word or LibreOffice.


A quiz file contains :

- Some information at the beginning: ID, name, short name;
- Questions: at least one question (there is no limit to the number of questions).

In Scripture App Builder, you add quiz files as you do with other kinds of books on the **Books** page. Click **Add Book...** and select the file.

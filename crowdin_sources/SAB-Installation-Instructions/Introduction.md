Scripture App Builder does what its name suggests: it helps you to build customized Scripture apps for smartphones and tablets.


You specify the Scripture files to use, the app name, the fonts, the colours, the about box information, the audio and the icons. Scripture App Builder will package everything together and build the customized app for you. You then install it on your mobile device, send it to others by Bluetooth or Wi-Fi transfer app, share it on microSD memory cards and publish it to app stores on the Internet.

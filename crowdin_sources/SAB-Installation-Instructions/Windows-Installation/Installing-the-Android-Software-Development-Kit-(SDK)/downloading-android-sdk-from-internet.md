# Downloading the Android SDK packages from the internet {#22d80858a4b68020b857d21e297bc5d9}


To install the Android SDK from the internet:

1. Launch **App Builder**.
2. Click the **Install Android SDK** button on the welcome page (or select **Tools → Install Android SDK** from the main menu).
3. Follow the instructions on each page of the **Install Android SDK** wizard to download each of the Android SDK packages and install them.

When you are asked to specify a target folder, a good place is **C:\sdk**.


Four packages will be downloaded and installed:

- Command line tools,
- Build Tools,
- Platform Tools, and
- Platform API.

If the installation was successful, you will see the version numbers displayed in green.

If any of the Build Tools, Platform Tools or Platform API is listed as “Not Found” (displayed in red), go to **Tools** → **Settings**, select the **Android SDK** tab, and click the **Install Packages** button to install them.


Click the **Check Installation** button to confirm that all the packages have been installed correctly.


You can skip section 2.3.2 and go straight to section 2.4.

# **Installing aeneas for audio-text synchronization** {#22d80858a4b68019bc68f230aa97588c}


Scripture App Builder and Reading App Builder use a tool called **aeneas** to synchronise text and audio.


To set up **aeneas** on Windows, there are several programs and modules to download and install: FFmpeg, eSpeak, Python and aeneas. These are installed with a single setup program.

1. Go to the **Download** page on your App Builder website [http://software.sil.org/scriptureappbuilder/download/](http://software.sil.org/scriptureappbuilder/download/) or [http://software.sil.org/readingeappbuilder/download/](http://software.sil.org/scriptureappbuilder/download/) and download the latest aeneas setup program for Windows. You will find it under the heading **Audio Synchronization Tools**.
2. The filename will be something like **aeneas-windows-setup-1.7.3.exe**.
3. Double-click the file you have downloaded to start the installation wizard.

2. On the **Select Components** page, you need the **Full Installation** which should be selected by default.

1. On the **Ready to Install** page, click **Install**.

	You will see the wizard running several different installers: for FFmpeg, eSpeak, Python. It will also install three Python modules.


	Before the wizard completes, you should see a command box appear for a few seconds which verifies the aeneas installation.

<u>**Important**</u>: If your App Builder was open while you installed aeneas, close it and start it again to ensure that it picks up the changes to your Path settings.

# Introduction {#23280858a4b6805c980bcf9e453a9ae5}


To add audio-text synchronization to apps built with Scripture App Builder, you need to create a **timing file** to go alongside each audio MP3 file. The timing files provide the information the app needs to highlight phrases in the text as the audio is playing.


You can choose between three different methods to create the timing files:

1. **Audacity**: listen to an audio file in the Audacity audio editor and lay down a labels track, placing a label at the start of each phrase.
2. **aeneas**: an automated method of synchronizing text and audio.
3. **HearThis**: record the audio line by line using HearThis and export timing files at the same time as producing the MP3 files

This document takes you through the first of these methods: using Audacity to create the timing files. Instructions on the other two methods can be found in the user manuals _Using HearThis for Audio Recording_ and _Using aeneas for Audio-Text Synchronization_.

**PLEASE NOTE**: Many users of Scripture App Builder are finding that **aeneas** is providing very accurate synchronization results, so we do recommend you try it out. Synchronising the text and audio of a whole New Testament could take you a month using Audacity, but less than an hour using aeneas!

Reading App Builder does what its name suggests: it helps you to build customized reading apps for smartphones and tablets. You can use it to make apps containing picture books, health and community development materials, song books, illustrated stories and libraries of easy-to-read books for new readers â€“ each with the option of synchronizing text and audio, highlighting each phrase as it is read. The app menus, icon, splash screen and colors can all be customized for your language and culture. You specify the text and audio files, the app name, the fonts, the colours, the about box information and the icons. Reading App Builder will package everything together and build the customized app for you. You then install it on your mobile device, send it to others by Bluetooth or Wi-Fi transfer app, share it on microSD memory cards and publish it to app stores on the Internet.

To install Reading App Builder on **Windows**, please follow the instructions in section 2. For **Linux**, please find the instructions in section 3.

For **Mac**, you can find the installation instructions in the document **Installing and Building Apps on a Mac**.

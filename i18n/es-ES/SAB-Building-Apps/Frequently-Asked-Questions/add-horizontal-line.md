# **How can I add a horizontal line to separate certain paragraphs in text?** {#23780858a4b6808195c4ce683bcba4a5}

Use the marker **\zhr** to add a horizontal line. This will add a _**hr**_ element in the HTML.

Please note that this is non-standard USFM, so this marker should not be used if you are submitting this same file to the Digital Bible Library.

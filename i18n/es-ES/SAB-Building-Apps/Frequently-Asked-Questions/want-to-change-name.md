The program that allows you to define and build apps is called “Scripture App Builder” but the app itself doesn’t have a name. It is up to you to choose the names for the apps you build.

You will not see “Scripture App” anywhere in the apps you create, so feel free to use an appropriate name in an international, national or local language. App names that work well in certain contexts will be less helpful in other contexts, which is why SAB allows you to contextualise it.

_The subsequent sections follow the project menu structure in Scripture App Builder. Each main project menu topic has sub-categories for each sub-menu and tabs._

# App Name {#23780858a4b68058adc2db3cf10dc94f}

The app name is what the user sees displayed on the phone under the app icon. Depending on the phone settings, the number of visible letters in the name may only be around 20 and may get truncated. Keep this in mind and keep the name short and descriptive.

You can use the **Translations**… button to set several app names, each based on the interface language of the phone (set under **Appearance → Interface → Languages**). Alternatively, you can just have one name in the actual target, vernacular language.

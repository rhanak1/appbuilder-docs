# Package {#23780858a4b680e9b358d58260083893}

_**The app package name needs to be unique and cannot change once the app is published.**_ The standard for an app package name is to begin with the reversed web address of the publishing organisation, e.g. if it is Wycliffe Bible Translators, the package name could begin with:

org.wycliffe

and will be followed by something identifying the language and type of publication (New Testament, Bible, etc.), e.g.

org.wycliffe.cccc.nnnn.bible

where ‘cccc’ is the country name and ‘nnnn’ is the language name.

_You may need to plan ahead when choosing a package name. If you just have one Bible book to publish but are intending on adding more books to the app as they’re available, it’s better to add the word “Bible” than to put the name of the book. Similarly, if you might publish a text version of a single book AND a storybook, add a descriptive word to the package name e.g. org.wycliffe.senegal.wolof.john.storybook_

:::

If you work for a Bible translation or publishing organization, you might have standards to follow for package names, so please contact your digital publications coordinator for advice on this.

Once you publish your app on an app store, you cannot change its package name later if you want users to continue to receive updates. The package name uniquely identifies the app. Those who install the app will be able to find its package name on their device. It will also appear in the web address for your app if you make it available on Google Play.

If you are building apps for **test purposes** on your devices, you can use a package name beginning with com.example, e.g.

com.example.test.app123

But remember to change it before you publish the app.

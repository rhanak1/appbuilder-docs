# The Main Font tab {#23880858a4b68083b630c3b02c2d303f}

SAB allows you to specify a main or “**common**” font for use in the app (by default). You can alternatively choose to specify a number of other fonts (using the **Font Files** tab) that will be embedded in the app for use with different books or book collections. If you provide several fonts, users will be able to choose between them in the Text Appearance popup and the Verse on Image editor.

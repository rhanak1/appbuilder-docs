# **The Borders tab** {#23780858a4b680eca12cc47a2dc9379e}

You can add a decorative border frame around the text in the app, for example:

![](/notion_imgs/borders-tab.23780858-a4b6-800e-81c7-f1d64bd3c3cc.png)

You can select a border from the gallery of border images supplied with Scripture App Builder, or you can create your own border.

To select a border from the border gallery:

1. Click **Choose from Gallery…**

2. Select an image from the gallery and click OK.

To add your own border:

1. Create the border as an image file (JPEG or PNG) in portrait orientation. Ensure that the middle rectangular area of the image is blank. This blank area is where the text will be displayed.

You do not need to provide a border image in landscape orientation. This will be generated automatically. It does not matter too much what the width-to-height ratio of the image is, since the app will cut up the border and arrange it for different screen sizes.

Try not to make the border too wide, otherwise there will be limited space to display the text.

1. Go to the **Appearance** → **Graphics** → **Border**

2. Click **Add Image…** and select the border image.

3. Ensure that the checkbox **Include a border around the text in this app** is selected.

4. If you want to display the border for some books and not others, or on main chapters but not book introductions, go to the Features page for each book and modify the **Show border around text** and **Show border around introduction**

Scripture App Builder takes the border image file you provide and finds the blank rectangle area inside of it. It then cuts up the remaining image into 8 pieces: top-left corner, top, top-right corner, left, right, bottom-left corner, bottom and bottom-right corner.

When the border is displayed on the app screen, the corner images are scaled according to the screen size, and the side, top and bottom images are scaled and stretched to fill the space between the corners. In this way, the border adapts itself to display with different screen sizes. This technique allows the app to display the border in full screen view, or when there is a toolbar displaying at the bottom.

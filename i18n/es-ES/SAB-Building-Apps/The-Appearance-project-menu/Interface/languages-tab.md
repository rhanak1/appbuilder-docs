# The Languages tab {#23780858a4b680d5bc32df70abf79aa4}

The Languages tab allows you to specify which interface languages are available for the user to select from. This is best determined by knowing the app’s intended audience and choosing languages that will meet their needs. NOTE: this does not refer to the actual language in which your Scripture text or other book resources are written.

SAB has a list of languages that already have interface translations, covering many of the world’s national languages e.g French, English, Spanish and Chinese. You can choose which languages the user can select from when they access the app’s settings. Use the **Add language…** button (see below) to add an interface language and provide the translation of all the terms.

SAB will detect what language the user’s phone is set to. This is normally one of the national languages in SAB’s list. At this point, you can specify what you want the app to do using one of two choices:

**Use the current system language of the device. If no translations exists in this language, use…**

Select this option to detect the phone’s current system language and try to match it with one of the languages you’ve provided. If the phone happens to have a language that is not in your list, you can specify which default language to choose.

:::tip

_Research where major communities in your target local language are living and what are the national languages in those areas. Provide those languages for them to choose from, and select one to be the default. For example, the Wolof people in francophone Senegal have diaspora communities in France and the USA. In this case, select French and English as available interface languages and perhaps select French as the default language if a user’s phone isn’t in English or French._

:::

**Use this language:**

Use this option to force the app’s interface to appear in a certain language, no matter what the phone may be set to. Users can still change the language to one of the ones you’ve provided in the app settings.

:::tip

_This option is useful if your app contains interface text or book resources (like Bible aids) in one particular national language. This would normally be if the specific audience are almost exclusively in just one country with one national language._

**Which interface languages do you want users to be able to choose from in the app Settings?**

This is the list of available interface languages. Choose all those that you think would help the app users, covering the countries where there are significant communities. Including a choice of languages does not significantly increase the size of the app.

Double-click a language name to specify the **Font**, **Size** and **Text Direction** (i.e. Left to Right) that the interface will display for that language.

**Add Language…**

Use this button to add your own interface language. You specify the name, language code, default font and size, and the text-direction (for right-to-left languages). Once you select OK, the new language will appear already selected at the very bottom of the interface languages list. Click on the **Translations** tab to enter the translated interface element names for this language.

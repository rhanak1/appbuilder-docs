# **The Translations tab** {#23780858a4b68005befac3e6709b0250}

The **Translations** tab allows you to modify the names of interface items in any of the languages you selected to be available in the app. If you added your own language, it will appear in the right-most tab.

Use the **Export** button to export a text file with all the interface items to translate, in each of the available languages. This is useful if you want to give the list to someone else to translate. If you added your own language, you may have to enter its code and translation for each item. E.g. if I add the Wolof language and code “wol” (using the **Add Language** button on the **Languages** tab), then export the interface translations list using the **Export** button, I can add the Wolof translations. In the exported text file, each interface item has a heading (e.g. **$ Menu_Bible**) followed by a list of language codes and their translation for the **Menu_Bible** interface element. At the end of the list for **Menu_Bible** I can add a line **wol: Injil**. I can then do this for all the interface elements.

Once the list is finished, use the **Import** button to import the changes into SAB.

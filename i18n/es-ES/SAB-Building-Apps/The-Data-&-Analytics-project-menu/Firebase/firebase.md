The Firebase menu allows you to configure multiple options available with a Firebase account. You can specify which options to enable using the Firebase Features tab, copy in your Firebase configuration file (.json) in the Firebase Configuration tab, and set up Push Notifications and In-App Messaging under their respective tabs, if so desired.

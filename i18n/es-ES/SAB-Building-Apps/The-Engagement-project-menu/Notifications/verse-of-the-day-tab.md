# The Verse of the Day tab {#23980858a4b680b09ee7d9f360b80cfe}

Your app can be configured to send a daily verse of the day. The verse appears as a notification in the deviceâ€™s notification tray. When you tap on it, the app will open and highlight the verse.

These notifications work offline. They are sent from the app rather than being sent over the internet.

To allow the user to have a verse of the day notification, do the following:

1. Select **Include Verse of the Day in this app**. If this option is not selected, Verse of the Day will not be included in the app and the app user will not be able to turn it on. You can allow the user to turn off/on verse of the day in the _app settings_ under the navigation drawer.

2. If you want the notifications to be turned on by default, select **Turn on Verse of the Day notifications by default**. If this option is not selected, the user will need to go to the Settings screen in the app in order to turn on the notifications.

3. Choose a **time of day** for the Verse of the Day to appear. Consider what default time of day in your cultural context might be the best for receiving the notification. The user will be able to change this in the _app Settings_.

4. Choose the appropriate **Christmas** and **Easter** date traditions.

5. Specify whether the verse can be displayed using the standard system font or whether it needs to be displayed using a custom font. We recommend you select the system font unless you have a more complex script that cannot be displayed well in such fonts.

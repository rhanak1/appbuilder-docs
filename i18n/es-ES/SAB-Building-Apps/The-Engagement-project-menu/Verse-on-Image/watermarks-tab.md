# The Watermarks tab {#23980858a4b680349c8cc8b5784777ed}

Use the Watermark tab to specify a small, PNG image that will be placed on all verse on image pictures. You can use this to “brand” your images so people associate them with your app, hopefully creating interest in installing the app itself and accessing God’s Word.

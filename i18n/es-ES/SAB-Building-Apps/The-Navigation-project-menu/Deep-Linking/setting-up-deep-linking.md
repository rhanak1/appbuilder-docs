# Setting up Deep Linking {#23980858a4b68060a066fc5ed188feb6}

To set up deep linking in your app:

1. Go to the **Navigation →** **Deep Linking** page within Scripture App Builder.
2. Select **Enable Deep Linking**.
3. Specify one or two link **schemes** to be associated with your app: a custom URI and/or a URL.

_**Custom URI Scheme**_

The first type of link scheme is a **custom URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier). This is a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and then any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or hyphen (-). It is followed by a colon and two forward slashes (://).

Here are some examples:

mamara-bible://

biblemalinke://

proverbstoday://

tharaka-scripture://

gospels-tanzania://

Make sure that you do not choose a custom URI already in use by a popular app, such as:

fb://                             Facebook

twitter://                     Twitter

whatsapp://                 WhatsApp

youtube://                   YouTube

youversion://               YouVersion Bible App

_**URL Scheme**_

The second type of scheme is a **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator), which is like a web address. It begins with http:// or https://. It can include a path.

Here are some examples:

https://mamara.org/

https://mamara.org/bible/

http://www.gospels-tanzania.org/

https://wycliffe.org/mexico/huichol/bible/

https://scriptureearth.org/mexico/hch/

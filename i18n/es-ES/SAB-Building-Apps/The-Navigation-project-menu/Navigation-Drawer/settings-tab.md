# The Settings tab {#23980858a4b6801a90d5c86e6ee93b0d}

The **Settings** tab allows you to specify which app settings the user can modify. The list of settings is determined by which options you have enabled in your app. For example, the **Verse of the Day** notification setting will only appear in the list if you have enabled Verse of the Day under the **Engagement** → **Notifications** project menu.

Click Show next to each setting you want the user to be able to modify in the app. These will appear under the Settings menu item in the app’s navigation drawer.

:::note

_To specify whether a setting option is turned on by default, see the respective setting’s menu item in the SAB project menu. E.g. see_ _**Engagement → Notifications → Verse of the Day**_ _to turn it on by default._

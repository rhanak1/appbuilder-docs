# Copy App {#23780858a4b680adb596e0d13ebf1471}

This will create a mirror image of the current project, by default adding the word “**(Copy)**” to the project name to distinguish it from the copied project. This may be useful in creating similar projects but for different languages, or creating a test project to experiment with.

:::note

_The project copy_ _**will have the same package name as the original**_, _so be sure to change it to avoid confusion or overwriting the original project installation._

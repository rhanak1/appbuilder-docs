# Create New Keystore {#23780858a4b680d3bbd8ecab84d8c9b2}

A keystore is a digital certificate file that ensures the app is legitimate. An app must be signed in this way so that it can installed on a phone. You may use an existing keystore or follow this wizard to create a new one. This process is also included as part of the “New App” wizard.

Enter a new filename for the keystore, such as “keystore1.” Specify a password. Click **Next** to continue.

Enter an alias name for a key to create within your new keystore, such as the default “key1”. Specify a password, which can be the same as the password you entered on the previous page.

:::note

_It is very important to securely store the password for your keystore. Once the app is published, it cannot be updated without the keystore password. Make sure someone else in your organization has access to the app keystore passwords._

On the **Certificate Issuer** page, provide details of your organisation in at least one of the fields. Click **Next** to continue.

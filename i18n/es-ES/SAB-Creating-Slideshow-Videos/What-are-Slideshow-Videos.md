# What are Slideshow Videos? {#23280858a4b680ca805affdffc304417}

Slideshow videos are videos created using a set of still images together with audio files from a _Scripture App Builder_ project. While the audio plays, the images will pan and/or zoom. Subtitles will be generated from the text in the app.

                                                                                                        [Jesus calms the storm â€“ in the Juni Kuin language of Peru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY3BrpoVbGI&list=PLoDMmx9LIxpPcT2qrXQXAkda5pcvuWIdh)
                                                      ```

The videos are MP4 files which can be shared with others, uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo, or integrated within a Scripture app.

# Lectionaries {#23780858a4b680ebb123c97a9aa5b94a}

To create a 3-year lectionary, for example, make one book per collection (season) for each year, i.e. Advent would have 3 separate books, one for each year. These books would be in SFM format and can have the Bible verses typed out in full. However, if you add the lectionary books to a Bible app that has all the referenced Scripture books, you can put links to the actual Scripture texts in the lectionary SFM files.

See the following:

- Preparing text for your lectionary in [SFM](/other-sfm-text-files) or [Word](/word-documents)
- Using a **[Problem Internal Link]** to access the books in your lectionary.
- Including **[Problem Internal Link]**.
- **[Problem Internal Link]**.

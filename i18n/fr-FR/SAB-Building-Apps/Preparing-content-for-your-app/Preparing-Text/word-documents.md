# Word Documents (.docx) {#23380858a4b680b58d2ee341113d5ccb}

SAB can import text and images from Microsoft Word (.docx) documents.
When Word documents are displayed in the app, basic formatting will be preserved such as character styles (bold, italic, underline), numbered lists, bullet points, hyperlinks, footnotes and simple tables.
To define separate chapters or pages, insert page breaks using CTRL+Enter.

:::note

_Even though Word documents may appear easier, they work best only for very simple story books. If you want more control over the formatting and features of the book, use the SFM format._

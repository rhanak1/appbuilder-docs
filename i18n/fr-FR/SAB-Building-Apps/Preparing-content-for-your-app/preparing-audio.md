# Preparing audio {#23380858a4b6802eb407eb375eb5e6b1}

If you want to include audio files in your app, these need to be in MP3, 3GP or WebM (Ogg Opus) audio format. Normally this should be one audio file per page or chapter. You can also include audio clips which are short audio files that are played when the user taps on a word, phrase or image.

If you have a picture story book, you can have a single audio file for the whole book or one audio file per page.

Keep the audio files at a size where the quality is good enough for a phone and where the file size is not too large.

:::tip

_Make sure that audio files are clearly and uniquely named. SAB will need to figure out which audio file to associate with which page or chapter, so clearly include the number in the file name (i.e. at the end of the name) using a leading zero._
_E.g._ _**my_book_page_01.mp3**_

_Audio from Faith Comes By Hearing will already have unique file names, so it is not recommended to change them._

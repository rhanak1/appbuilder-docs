# The Android Versions tab {#23780858a4b680788bc7faeed1f1c14f}

The **Target Android Platform** refers to the current android platform that Scripture App Builder supports. This is the required platform supplied by Google who update this requirement about once a year. All new apps being published to the Play Store have to support this version, and existing apps will have to be upgraded within a few years depending on Googleâ€™s specifications. New versions of Scripture App Builder are designed to keep pace with these requirements and simply compiling and republishing the app with the latest version makes the app compliant.

In contrast, the **Minimum Android Platform** can be specifically set to target a generation of Android phones using a particular Android version or later. In general, the older the platform (meaning the smaller the version number) the older the phone that can run the app. However, if you app uses a feature that only works on newer phones, this minimum platform with have to be set accordingly.

# Project {#23780858a4b680219d16f22a44b1faaf}

The Project tab allows you to name or rename your project. The **Project Name** is not seen by the user, but it is important as SAB uses it to name the actual project folder on your computer (see _How SAB stores your project data files_). If you will using a partner organization like Kalaam Media to publish your project to the Play Store, it is helpful for them if the project name starts with the language code and a hyphen e.g.

wol-Miracles of Jesus

You can assign a **Project Group** to nest similar projects together in SABâ€™s project tree view. This might be useful if you are working on multiple languages. Creating a Project Group will also create a project group subfolder under your **App Projects** folder.

:::tip

_If you modify a project name or group name later, you may have to close any affected projects in SAB, look in the App Projects folder and move projects back into their correct group._

:::

The **Project Description** is just for your own purposes and is not see by the user.

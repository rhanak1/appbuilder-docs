**Compression and Encryption**

By default, SAB encrypts and compresses the data in the app. Normally, you should leave this setting enabled.

You can also choose to prevent users from taking screenshots in the app. A possible reason to enable this is if you have copyrighted art in the app and the artist does not want people to be able to copy their pictures without an associated copyright notice.

**Restricted Users**

You can choose to let anyone install the app or restrict the installation in the following various ways:

**Allow only selected devices to use this app**

This is the most restrictive setting and may be applicable in certain high-security contexts where only a very specific set of people should be able to install the app, based on their exact phone ID or serial number. Click **Specify Devices…** and add an entry for each phone you want to permit.

**Require a device-specific access code to use this app**

With this option you can create a series of access codes to send to users so they can access the app. This requires one or more administrator accounts to be set up to send codes to users. This method allows a broader reach than just having selected devices set up to install the app.

**Require each user to register with their details when they first use the app**

This option is useful for setting up a campaign directed at registering users and keeping them informed on updates and advertising things like listening groups to enhance Scripture Engagement in a community.

**Show a calculator on start-up. Entering a code will give access to the app content**

This option is useful for high-security situations where the app needs to be completely hidden on a phone. A specific, long, digital number can be specified (e.g. 84567.294) as a code to put in the calculator’s number field. Then hit = to transform and open the app.

:::note

_It is advised to make the app name and icon correspond to those of a calculator app._

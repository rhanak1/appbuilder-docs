# The Book Colors tab {#23880858a4b68053b3def5a5f094e14b}

The Book Colors tab allows you to specify the tile background colors in the Grid View of the book selector (on the app’s main menu). If your app does not have any Scripture books, this tab will be empty.

The Grid View groups Scripture books by category e.g. Pentateuch, Historical, Gospel, PaulineEpistle. You can specify the background color for each category and for all three themes. Double-click on a category to display the **Edit Color** selection dialog for all three theme. Use **Select Color…** to launch the color picker for each theme entry.

# **The Formatting tab** {#23880858a4b680b39bf9f3e04fae230c}

The **Formatting** tab gives specific control on whether chapter and verse numbers are displayed and how they are formatted. It also allows you to specify whether the words of Jesus can be displayed in red (if available in the current book) and whether theyâ€™re in red by default. If turned on, this setting is available to be modified by the user in the app settings.

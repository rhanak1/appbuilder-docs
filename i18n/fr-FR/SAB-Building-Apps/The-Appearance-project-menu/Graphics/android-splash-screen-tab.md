# **The Android Splash Screen tab** {#23780858a4b6801d90d4edf92e86d4d9}

A splash screen is a title screen for your app that can automatically display for a specified number of milliseconds when your app launches. A splash screen can be an attractive “intro” to your app and should be set to display long enough for the user to read any text on it, but not so long that it becomes annoying.

There are three recommended sizes for Android splash screens. Presumably, the phone’s system will choose the one most appropriate for the particular phone’s resolution and aspect ratio. If one doesn’t fit exactly, we assume the OS will scale the nearest size to fit. In that case, for best results you should at least supply the largest size (720x1280).

_If the Scripture text has already been published as a physical book, you might use the cover of that book as your splash screen to show continuity with the printed text. You could alternatively use a design incorporating your app icon with the app name. Try to harmonize the colors in the splash screen with the icon and interface colors._

:::

Check the box to **Show splash screen on start up,** and set the number of milliseconds. Around 800 – 1000 milliseconds is a reasonable, suggested interval.

# The Backgrounds tab {#23980858a4b6804986a4c761247d0b3a}

Users can either use one of the backgrounds included in the app or choose their own background from their phone image gallery.

As part of your Scripture Engagement strategy, try to include a set of backgrounds in your app that might appeal to the users and prompt them to share verses with others.

SAB provides several default images but you can add more in several ways:

Use the **Add Image**… button to add images that you provide. These can be photos that you, friends or colleagues have taken, or ones from a website. Just make sure you have the rights to use the images. The **Backgrounds** tab has links to several sites that provide free images, though you should still give credit in your About box.

You can also add images from the SAB gallery using **Choose from Gallery…** Pay attention to the **File Size** of the images, as your app will increase in size with each one.

:::tip

_Try to choose images that are relatively simple with an uncluttered center area so that the overlaid text can be easily read._

:::

We recommend using the **Crop each image to make it square** and **Resize the image files to reduce the app size** checkboxes. Pick a maximum width that reflects an average screen resolution of your target phones e.g. 720 - 1024 pixels.

You can also provide a choice of fonts for users to apply to the text in their images. To do this, go to the **Appearance** → **Fonts** → **Font Files** tab.

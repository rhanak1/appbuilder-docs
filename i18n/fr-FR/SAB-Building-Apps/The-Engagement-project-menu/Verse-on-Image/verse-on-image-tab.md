# The Verse on Image tab {#23980858a4b68039aee3da778c0521be}

To activate the Verse on Image function in your app, check the box **Include the ‘Verse on Image’ editor in the app**.

If you have audio and timing files for the selected verse, it is possible to share the image as a video with the text and audio combined. To activate this option, go to the **Verse on Image** tab and check the box **Allow saving as a video, combing the text and audio.** This will require the image processing library, **FFmpeg**, to be included within the app.

:::note

_The FFmpeg library will add around 52MB to your APK by default. You can reduce the size of the APK by creating separate APK files for each phone architecture, including only the respective portions of the library in each one. See the Multiple APKs section under_ _**App**_ _→_ _**APK**_.

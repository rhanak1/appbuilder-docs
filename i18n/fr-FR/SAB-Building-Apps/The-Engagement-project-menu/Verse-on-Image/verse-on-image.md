# Verse on Image {#23980858a4b680c38d8de202e05fd05f}

Including the Verse on Image feature can be an important Scripture Engagement tool to encourage believers to share God’s word with each other, or to evangelize non-believers. It can also be used to create Facebook, Instagram or other social media postings to increase interest in the language and/or in spiritual topics.

If you tap on a verse in the app, it will be selected (underlined) and the text selection toolbar will appear at the bottom of the screen. On this toolbar you can tap the image button which will take you to the Verse on Image editor:

_If your book is not a Scripture text (i.e. does not have verses), by default you will not be able to tap on a sentence to highlight it. If you want users to be able to select the sentence, you will need to add \v verse markers to the book file but then hide the verse markers so they don’t show. To do this, select the book in the collection and choose the_ _**Features**_ _tab. Use the_ _**Show Verse Numbers**_ _selector and turn it to off._

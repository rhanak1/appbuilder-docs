# Assistant (AI) {#23980858a4b6804684b2e7f74741aa74}

The AI Assistant provides Bible engagement help on a selected passage, such as a whole chapter or selected verses. You can set up the Assistant with a list of possible tasks, for example:

- “Give me some Bible study questions”
- “Share some devotional thoughts”
- “Suggest ways to apply this to my life”
- “Show how this passage fits into the message of the book”

These tasks are displayed in the Assistant tab. When the user selects one of them, the app connects to an AI provider, asks the question and displays the received response on the screen.

To configure the AI Assistant:

1. On the **Assistant Tasks** tab, add some tasks, either by clicking **Add Task** or **Add Task from Gallery**. For each task you will need:

- **A task name**: This is the internal name for the task, not displayed to the user.Example: _“Bible Study Questions”._
- **A task title**: This is the title of the task which is displayed to the user. Example: _“Give me some Bible study questions”._ Write the title in the languages of the app user interface. You can provide translations.
- **A task prompt**: This is the prompt to be sent to the AI provider when a user selects this task. It is not visible to the user.Example: _“Look at %reference% and give me six questions for a Bible study. These should be discovery Bible study style questions which encourage engagement with the text and discussion about the content, meaning and application.”_

When defining prompts, you can use the following variables:

- **%reference%** - for the current Bible reference
- **%book%** - for the current book name
- **%chapter%** - for the current chapter number
- **%biblical-language%** - for the current biblical language (Greek or Hebrew).

2. On the **AI Provider** tab, choose a provider from the possible options.

3. On the corresponding **Settings** tab, e.g. “OpenAI Settings” or “Groq Settings”, enter the API key for the provider. You will need to have created an account with the provider for this, as well as specifying a billing method.

4. Test the Assistant in the **Viewer**

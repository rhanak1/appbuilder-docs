# Tab Types (Book Tabs) {#23980858a4b680bfa36eeafd188ae295}

It is possible to create an app which displays books with two or more tabs, for example:

- A “Text” tab in which you display the Scripture text, and a corresponding “Questions” tab which contains Bible study questions.
- A “Text” tab in which you display the Scripture text, and a “Commentary” tab which contains an explanation and application of the text.
- A “Song” tab in which you display the words of a song, and a corresponding “Music” tab which contains the music score or guitar chords.

Tabs can be labelled with a **title** or an **icon**.

You can associate **audio files** with a tab.

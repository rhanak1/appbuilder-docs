# Build Android App APK {#23780858a4b680788860edd0c4f738fa}

This menu item will initiate the compilation of the currently selected project, duplicating the functionality of the **Build Android App APK** button on the SAB tool bar. Note that multiple, device-specific APKs will be built instead of one, comprehensive APK if the **Generate device-specific APKs…** option is selected under the **App → APK → Multiple APKs** tab.

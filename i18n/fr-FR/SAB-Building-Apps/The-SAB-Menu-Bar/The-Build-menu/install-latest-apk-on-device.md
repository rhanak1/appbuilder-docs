# **Install Latest APK on Device** {#23780858a4b680719f1bfa7528b7b007}

This duplicates the functionality of the **Install APK...** button on the SAB tool bar. If a phone is connected and set up for USB debugging, SAB will attempt to copy and launch the currently selected projectâ€™s last built APK. See _**Installing the app on your phone**_. If no APK is found for the project, SAB will prompt you to compile one.

# The Android SDK tab {#23780858a4b680b9bdc7d7f343337d17}

**Android SDK Location**

The Android Software Development Kit is a required set of code libraries for building apps. The normal SAB installation process should prompt you to download and install the Android SDK, and the **Android SDK Location** field should show the location of the installed files. If for any reason this is blank, or you need to change the version of the SDK, you can either **Browse** to another version already on your computer, or use **Install Android SDK…** to download and install a new version.

**Android SDK Packages**

If installed correctly the four SDK packages should have green version numbers displayed (see example below).

Click on **Check Installation** to make sure the four SDK packages are installed. If any of the four fields are listed as ‘Not Found,’ click **Install Android SDK…** to install or reinstall the packages.

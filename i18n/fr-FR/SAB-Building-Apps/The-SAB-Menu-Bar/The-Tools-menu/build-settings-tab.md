**Offline Mode**

The actual program that compiles your project to create an app installer file is named Gradle. The first time you compile your app, Gradle will need to download some additional files to run. From that point on, it will try to check from time to time if more updates are required. If you do not have internet available after the initial extra download, check the **Use compiler offline** box. You may, however, need to uncheck this when you have an internet connection to get any updates.

**Memory Use**

Normally, you do not have to modify this value. The accompanying explanatory text explains when you may need to change it.

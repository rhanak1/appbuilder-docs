# The Files tab {#23780858a4b680dbbaa7e0a028c347b5}

**Audio Files**

Audio files can comprise some of the largest project data files. Use the setting here to tell SAB whether to keep audio files in their source location or copy them to the project folderâ€™s _audio data subfolder_. This second option will make it easier to save or share the project, but will double the size the audio files will take up on your computer.

**Fine Tune Timings**

As explained in the tab text, SAB will automatically look in the specified folder for saved timing files and copy them to the project. You can modify the location if necessary.

# View Logs {#23780858a4b680368226e90bf4c4bec4}

As SAB builds an app APK file, it opens a window that displays the internal steps it is taking as it compiles the app. Once you close this window (when the app compilation has finished), you can still view the output or any error information in the View Logs window. There are two tabs—one for any error information and one for the compilation output. These are useful if you need to figure out why a build failed and/or can be sent to a technical specialist for help.

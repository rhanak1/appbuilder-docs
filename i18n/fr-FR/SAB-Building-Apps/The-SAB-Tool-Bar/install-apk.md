# Install APK {#23780858a4b680c29300db94c1b7f318}

This duplicates the functionality of the **Install Latest APK on device** item under the **Build** menu. If a phone is connected and set up for USB debugging, SAB will attempt to copy and launch the currently selected project’s last built APK. See _**Installing the app on your phone**_. If no APK is found for the project, SAB will prompt you to compile one.

# **Installing all packages from the Internet** {#22d80858a4b680af8be0fb95a8e69464}

To install all the required software from the command line, type:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y (replace with app builder name)-app-builder
```

Note: **Wasta-Linux** does not automatically install recommended packages. To get everything installed, also install android-sdk-installer.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y (replace with app builder name)-app-builder android-sdk-installer
```

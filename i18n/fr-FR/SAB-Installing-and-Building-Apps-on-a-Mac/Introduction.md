This document provides information on how to install Scripture App Builder and build apps on an Apple macOS system. It is possible to build an Android app using SAB on Windows, Linux or Mac, but if you want to build an iOS app for the iPhone or iPad, you will need to build it using a Mac computer.

| **App Builder** <br/>**Platform** | **Build**<br/>**Android Apps** | **Build**<br/>**iOS Apps** |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Windows                           | ✅                              |                            |
| Linux                             | ✅                              |                            |

Creating an Android app on a Mac is essentially the same process as it is for Windows or Linux. To create a corresponding iOS app, you will need to enter a few more configuration items.
The apps generated for iOS will run on an iPhone or iPad with iOS 12.2 or higher.

# Introducing HearThis {#23280858a4b68074b152c63303aca1a4}

HearThis provides a do-it-yourself alternative for communities wanting to get translated Scripture text into audio form. It is designed to make Bible recording easy!

HearThis automatically finds your Paratext translations and walks you through recording it, one bit at a time.  Not a great reader? Need to read it again?  Just press on the record button and try again, until you get it right.  Then click the arrow, and see the next thing you need to read.

HearThis can produce all the files needed for adding audio when using Scripture App Builder â€“ including the timing files for audio-text synchronization.

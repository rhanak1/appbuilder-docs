# Windows Installation {#22d80858a4b680aa9d48c8f041b44dab}

In order to run your App Builder on Windows, you need to have 3 components installed on your computer:

1. Your App Builder
2. Java Development Kit (JDK)
3. Android Software Development Kit (SDK)

4. Aeneas audio-text synchronization tool.
